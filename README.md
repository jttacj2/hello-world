# hello-world


I just wanted to say hi to you, yes you!

I like to meet new people; thus, I am glad you have come my way. I recently got new floring and am enjoying the new look it has created for my home. 

Now I am working on creating a couple of branches to see how it works within GitHub... Here's to hoping I'm doing this right.
